This website was tested in google dev tools, each page responsiveness was tested separately to ensure that everything works well. Also all features of the page 
are scaling as intended in tablet and mobile devices.
The contact form is reacting with a message, when the text fields are not completed.

Site was tested on the following browsers:
* Google Chrome
* Mozilla Firefox
* Microsoft Edge
* Safari\(audio and video files do not work yet in Safari,(I have to fix this)).
 
## Deployment

Throughout the project commits were made after every important feature of the website.
The `HTML` and `CSS` code passes the oficial validator with no issues.

There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.

The project has been deployed on [GitHub](https://marcel-balint.github.io/ucd-milestone-project1/.).
