                       <p class="indent">The Monkees story began in the fall of 1965, when Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider, a pair of producers whose Raybert Productions had a deal with Columbia Pictures and their TV branch Screen Gems,
                       came up with an idea for a television series about a rock group. Inspired by Richard Lester's groundbreaking comedies with the Beatles, A Hard Day's Night and Help!, 
                       Rafelson and Schneider imagined a situation comedy in which a four-piece band had wacky adventures every week and occasionally burst into song. The NBC television network liked the idea,
                       and production began on The Monkees in early 1966. Don Kirshner, a music business veteran who was a top executive at Colgems Records (a label affiliated with Columbia/Screen Gems), 
                       was appointed music coordinator for the series, and Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, a producing and songwriting team,
                       signed on to handle most of the day-to-day chores of creating music for the show's fictive band. A casting call went out for four young men to play the members of the group,
                       and Rafelson and Schneider's choices for the roles were truly inspired. Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork were musicians with solid performing and recording experience 
                       who also had a flair for playing comedy, while Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones were primarily actors but had also dabbled in pop music and had strong vocal abilities.
                       As the show went before the camera, Kirshner had Boyce and Hart take the four leads into the studio to begin recording the songs that would be featured on the show each week.
                       While initially the cast was only going to provide vocals for material Boyce and Hart had already recorded,
                       the producers were impressed enough with Nesmith's songwriting skills that they chose to use a few of his tunes and let him produce them. With this, 
                       the Monkees took their first step toward evolving into a proper, self-sufficient rock band.</p>
                      
                       <p>The Monkees debuted on NBC in the fall of 1966 and was an immediate hit in the ratings, while "Last Train to Clarksville," the group's first single,
                       had become a number one hit a few weeks earlier (the self-titled debut album would top the chart in October). 
                       Rafelson, Schneider, and Kirshner shrewdly allowed the show to promote the records and vice-versa, 
                       and while the notion that television time could sell pop records was hardly new (Ricky Nelson proved that almost a decade earlier), 
                       no one had made it work with quite the success the Monkees achieved almost immediately. </p>
                       
                       <p> Good Times! When their 45th anniversary rolled around in 2011, the trio of Dolenz, Jones, and Tork decided to re-form and headed out on an extensive tour of North America that lasted throughout the summer. 
                        Further plans for touring were scotched by the bandmembers' reluctance to spend the rest of the year wearing themselves out due to the grueling pace. It was to be their last set of performances with Davy Jones,
                        who passed away at the age of 66 in February of 2012. His death proved to be the inspiration for Nesmith to rejoin the group,
                        and at the end of the year they headed out for a string of reunion dates that featured a touching tribute to Jones each night.
                        They toured in 2013 and 2014 as well, before Nesmith bowed out again. In the established Monkees tradition, Tork and Dolenz continued without him for a 2015 jaunt.
                        At this point it may have seemed that the Monkees were finished as a recording act,
                        but in early 2016, Dolenz announced that the band had recorded a new album. Made up of songs that were never finished in the '60s and songs written for the band by modern artists like Rivers Cuomo of Weezer, 
                        Ben Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie, and XTC's Andy Partridge, Good Times! was produced by Fountains of Wayne's Adam Schlesinger and appeared on the band's longtime label Rhino in May of 2016.
                        Christmas Party The Monkees reunited with Schlesinger in 2018 to make the holiday album Christmas Party. 
                        Like Good Times! before it, Christmas Party featured songs by Partridge and Cuomo, along with a song co-written by Peter Buck and Scott McCaughey.</p>
